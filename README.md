This resource provides R code and bash file to reproduce the key results in the manuscript. 
The analysis framework is adapted from standard single-cell workflows established by the Satija lab. 

The analysis were organized into four modular components :  
  1.scRNA_seq_only contains scripts for removing batch effects, generating buffer fly plot of Neftal meta modules and scoring mesenchymal features
  2.multi_omics contains scripts for merging scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq as well as performing downstream analysis 
  3.intergration contains script for running CellChat to infer cell-cell communication and intergrating public datasets with our own datasets
  4.RNA-seq contains scripts for processing and analyzing bulk RNA-seq
